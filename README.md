# Image-Classification-Deep-Learning-
The goal of this project was to create a deep learning model capable of classifying images into one of ten categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The dataset used for this task is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images.
